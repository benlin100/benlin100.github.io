Hi everyone! Welcome to my blog :)  
  
My name is Ben and I am currently enrolled in Metis's Data Science bootcamp. I graduated in economics from UC Berkeley in 2016, then began working at a machine learning startup, Vidora. While my passion lies in marketing and product development, I recoginize the value that data science can bring to both those ends. 
  
I really hope you enjoy reading about my projects. 
  
  
### P.S.

I'd love to connect and grab some coffee/food - please don't hesitate to reach out!

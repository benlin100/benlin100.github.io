title: Week 1 - Using MTA Data to Optimize Food Truck Locations
--- 
  
  
First week of Metis is in the books! While I was pretty nervous and anxious going in, I had a great time. From meeting the instructors to my classmates, everyone at Metis is like-minded and dedicated to learning which makes a very positive and inclusive atmosphere. On the first day, we hit the ground running with Project Benson - a Data Exploratory Project that used the MTA Turnstile Data in New York.  
The project was that each group had to create a scenario, in which we would present to a “company” about how we could leverage the MTA data to help them. I really enjoyed how open-ended the first assignment was because it forced us think about Data Science from the other perspective. My group and I decided to create a fake Mexican food company, BurritoFull, 
that was looking to place a fleet of food trucks around NYC. Our presentation was focused on leveraging the MTA data to optimize the placement of their food trucks.
